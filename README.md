# # DAOshboard


A web app for the DAO dashboard during the schelling point hackathon https://gitcoin.co/issue/covalenthq/covalent-gitcoin-bounties/14/100027481

Calculates the DAO transparency level given information from the covalent api

#Current State

This is a simple app powered by the covalent API. There is still alot of work that needs to be done,
but I think it highlights what can be done with the covalent API. I think the python covalent
API needs some work with extra documentation and extra features. 

The Transparency score currently is very simply calculated, I wanted the score to be more complex
,but I was being rate limited by the API and I think it is out of the scope of this hackathon. Overall
I think the covalent API has alot of potential to be a useful tool for developers


#### WARNING DO NOT USE THIS AS A PRODUCTION TYPE SOFTWARE TO DETERMINE THE TRANSPARENCY OF A DAO ####
